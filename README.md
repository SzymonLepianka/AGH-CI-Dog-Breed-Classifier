# AGH-CI-Dog-Breed-Classifier
## 2022 Computational Intelligence Project
Dog Breed Classifier implementation for CI course on AGH UST.

## Topic of the project
Image classification of Stanford Dogs

Author: Szymon Lepianka

### Description

Main goal of the project is to construct a neural network model that would be able to classify breeds of dogs based on their images. It will be done by training few models and choosing best one. Dataset used comes from kaggle.com:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset

and contains over 20,000 images of 120 dog breeds.
